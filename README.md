Website to host JavaScript snippets of code (from processing.js). Built at a 1 week long UT Dallas computer science camp to teach kids how to program using Khan Academy's computer science lessons. 

Hosted at http://utdcs.herokuapp.com/ - check out what my students made! (Scripts with mouse support weren't working for some reason, so you can check out those hosted on Khan Academy.)
